This project involves tasks related to breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques. 

Firstly, the breast cancer dataset is utilized to create a training set, and the base rate of malignant cancer occurrence is computed. 
The main focus is on building a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library. The decision tree's performance is evaluated by varying the maximum depth, and the results are visualized through plots showcasing accuracy on the full dataset and 10-fold cross-validated accuracy for different depth settings. 

Subsequently, the exploration extends to random forest classifiers, involving the determination of optimal parameters such as the number of trees (n estimators) and maximum depth. 
The comparison between random forests and single trees is analyzed. Additionally, the dependability of estimates is assessed by calculating the 10-fold cross-validation accuracy for various decision tree classifiers with different max depth settings across multiple random states. 

The findings are presented through a bar chart illustrating the frequency of the best max depth settings. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of classification techniques and the robustness of parameter choices in machine learning models.
